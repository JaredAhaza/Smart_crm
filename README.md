## üîê Role-Based Permissions

### Manager
- Full CRUD access to all resources
- Can delete leads and contacts
- Access to all features

### Agent
- Read, create, and update access
- **Cannot delete** leads or contacts
- Full access to notes, reminders, and correspondence

## üìä Audit Trail

The system automatically logs all changes to leads and contacts:
- **Created**: When new records are added
- **Updated**: When records are modified (with field-level changes)
- **Deleted**: When records are removed
- **User attribution**: Tracks who made each change
- **Timestamp**: Records when changes occurred

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Backend Architecture
- **Django REST Framework**: Chosen for rapid API development and excellent documentation
- **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready database with JSON field support for audit logs
- **Celery + Redis**: Asynchronous task processing for reminders
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication suitable for API-first architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vue.js 3**: Modern reactive framework with excellent developer experience
- **Composition API**: Better TypeScript support and code organization
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design system
- **Axios**: Reliable HTTP client with request/response interceptors

### Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Easy local development and deployment
- **Multi-stage builds**: Optimized container sizes
- **Volume mounting**: Hot reload for development

## üîß Development Setup

### Local Development (without Docker)
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DJANGO_DEBUG=1
POSTGRES_DB=smartcrm
POSTGRES_USER=smartcrm
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=smartcrm
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Frontend

```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Role-based permissions (manager vs agent)
- [ ] CRUD operations for leads and contacts
- [ ] Search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Notes and reminders creation
- [ ] Correspondence logging
- [ ] Audit trail verification
- [ ] Celery reminder processing

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Considerations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure database backups
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Use production-grade Redis and PostgreSQL

##  Assumptions Made

1. **User Management**: Users are created by administrators or self-registration
2. **Data Validation**: Basic validation with option to extend
3. **Email Integration**: Reminder system is prepared for email integration
4. **File Uploads**: Not implemented but architecture supports it
5. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration not implemented but possible
6. **Mobile Support**: Responsive design but no mobile app

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Short Term
- [ ] Email integration for reminders
- [ ] File upload for correspondence
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Bulk operations for leads/contacts
- [ ] Email templates for correspondence

### Long Term
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Mobile application
- [ ] Advanced workflow automation
- [ ] Integration with external CRM systems
- [ ] Machine learning for lead scoring
